Hello, Everyone!
I am Dhroov gupta. BTech Undergraduate student at The NorthCap University,Gurgaon.
I am participating in the BOSS 2018.
It's my first experience in the open source development and i am enjoying contributing int it.
When you write a piece of code and the whole community see and appreciate your work,it feels amazing and
it motivates you to contribute more.
BOSS 2018 has almost completed one month and i am contributing since then, i can say that these days taught me
a lot more than my entire time since i learned web development.

Cheers to all the mentors and contributors.
